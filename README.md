## Introduction
In public health, contact tracing is the process of identification of persons who may have come into contact with an infected person ("contacts") and subsequent collection of further information about these contacts. By tracing the contacts of infected individuals, testing them for infection, treating the infected and tracing their contacts in turn, public health aims to reduce infections in the population. 
Diseases for which contact tracing is commonly performed include tuberculosis, vaccine-preventable infections like measles, sexually transmitted infections (including HIV), blood-borne infections, some serious bacterial infections, and novel infections (e.g. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2). 
The current outbreak of the Novel Crorona virus(COVID-19) also comes under the category of novel infections and thus is one of the infections where contact tracing  can prove extremely useful.
<p> The aim of this project is to build an application which can be used by the Health Ministry Of India to trace potential carriers of the virus and contain the outbreak.Although this application has some vulnerabilties and limitations , it can prove extremely useful to trace the source of the infection, locate places where the infected person has been to and trace other potentially infected people.
<p>The sole purpose of the application is prevent the COVID-19 from spreading and infecting people across the nation. The application is not meant to be used to collect user data for commercial benefit or for private use.The application is made to save lives and swiftly contain the outbreak so that the situation can be resolved in minimum time.
  
 ## How does the application work?
 1.The users are asked to install the application in their smartphones and a create new account for themselves so that each user can be uniquely identified.
 <br>
 2.The users(civilians) are asked to use the application whenever they go in public spaces and enable the services.By enabling the services , the interactions of two people can be logged in a database.The application can be closed as soon as the user comes back home.
 <br>
 3.Medical workers and authorised healthcare workers are provided special login ,which has to be directly entered into the database.Using these special logins , the medical officers are directed to a special activity where they can search for a person's logged interactions using the person's phone number.So if a user contracts the virus , his/her interactions can be viewed to identify other infected people 
 <br>
 4. All the details (like with whom, where, date and time, phone number) interactions of the person can be seen . These details can help the medical officers to identify other infected people and isolate them before they spread the virus .
 <br>
  5.Also the interactions can be visualised on a map so as to identify places with higher rate of spread. 
  <br>
  6.Apart from allowing the medical officers to see the interactions of one person , if one of the user's interaction is also infected ,his/her interactions can also be viewed.
  
 ## Requirements
 1.Firebase Firestore database and authentication.
 <br>2.Nearby Connections API
 <br>
 3.Google Maps API
